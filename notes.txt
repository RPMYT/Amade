I was thinking you could achieve process isolation by setting _ENV to an empty table with index and newindex metamethods
rawget/rawset would bypass your metamethods
so just overwrite those üòÅ
make em still work
and bypass user metamethods
but not ones on kernel objects

- Exo

and
make all of your system calls yield the process to the scheduler
and
provide a bufferable system call API
or at least file I/O api
so a program can set up some shit it wants to do
and yield once to the kernel

- Exo

does CC have the
debug library?
available
epic
you can yield to the scheduler in a call hook
to emulate preemptive multitasking
